# hotseat
The board game with hot questions and even hotter wings. Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzrgbu8gEMIIK3r4Se1dOZWSZzUSadfZ" target="_blank">Hot Ones</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5zqCr5bpjU" target="_blank">this YouTube video</a>, the current bird's eye view/plan for the board game is:
1. Roll dice and move that number of spaces
2. Land on a space that specifies a heat number (1-5) and a set number (1-3). 
3. Eat a chicken wing/appropriate substitute with that heat of sauce on it (bring your own sauces, 5 = hottest), then answer a question randomly chosen from that set of questions from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/style/36-questions-that-lead-to-love.html" target="_blank">NYT 36 questions to fall in love</a> repository.
4. Next person's turn, repeat steps 1-3.

Longer-term features:
1. Maybe some kind of prize for winning?
2. Ability to add your own questions to the pool, and sort them into sets
3. Maybe you can adjust the frequency of heat levels or something

### Current Learning Plan
- As a start, I'll run through the 30-hour introductory JavaScript course from Codecademy, available <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/introduction-to-javascript/exercises/intro" target="_blank">here</a>. Goal: finish by next Friday, May 8th.
